# Staging Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployment

# Required: Your GCP Project ID
project_id = "your-actual-project-id"

# Required: GCP Region for resources
region = "asia-northeast1"

# Optional: Base name for services (will be suffixed with -staging)
service_name = "culture-web"

# Load Balancer Configuration (Optional for staging)
# Option 1: Direct Cloud Run access (default, cost-effective)
enable_load_balancer = false

# Option 2: With Load Balancer + CDN (production-like testing)
# enable_load_balancer = true
# domains = ["staging.your-domain.com"]
# enable_cdn = true
# redirect_http_to_https = true

# Direct Cloud Run deployment is recommended for staging to minimize costs.
# Enable load balancer only when testing production-like setup.
